        "First up, we have what is known as a NOT gate. This is one of the most basic operations that you can do in a computer; it simply flips the bit value. A 0 becomes 1, or a 1 becomes 0. We use a gate known as the X gate, `.x()` for this, writing the target qubit number inside the parenthesis. This is commonly referred to by either name, an X or a NOT gate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, let's look at something uniquely quantum, the Hadamard gate. This gate puts a qubit into a superposition, which hopefully you've already learned in one of your Fall Fest workshops! We can apply a hadamard gate simply, by using `.h()` and writing the target qubit number inside the parenthesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The last gate we'll look at for now is the CNOT gate. There's a lot of ways to examine what this gate is or what it does. To keep it simple, let's say that this is the entanglement gate. It entangles two qubits together. We apply a CNOT gate by using `.cx()` and writing the two qubit numbers in the parenthesis.\n",
