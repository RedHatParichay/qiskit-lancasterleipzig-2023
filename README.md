# qiskit-lancasterleipzig-2023

We are excited to announce that Lancaster University Leipzig is one of the 2 institutions based in Germany hosting an extension event as part of this year's Qiskit Fall Fest – a global gathering of quantum computing enthusiasts and experts. Qiskit, powered by IBM, is a great quantum computing software delivered in the form of a Python library. It allows students and researchers to create and simulate quantum circuits and algorithms. At Lancaster University Leipzig, we are committed to exploring the multifaceted realm of Quantum Computing, aiming to provide students with a holistic perspective on this cutting-edge field. To achieve this, we have planned a series of seminars and workshops that strike a perfect balance between academic rigour and real-world industrial insights. Our event is an integral part of IBM's Fall Fest, and we are proud to be associated with this global initiative. For more information, here is the event’s official [website](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest) (where you can see LU Leipzig being featured as part of the extension events hosts).

Come and meet one of the co-founders of [Kipu Quantum](https://kipu-quantum.com/)! Dr Enrique Solano. Kipu Quantum is a German quantum computing startup based in Karlsruhe and Berlin. What makes Kipu unique is its focus on application and hardware-specific quantum algorithms that are packaged into software products. 

# Dr Enrique Solano 
He is a very experienced individual in leading international research groups and centres in academic institutions as well as disruptive and productive innovation teams in deep tech startups. He has also founded another startup based in Spain, [Quanvia](https://www.quanvia.com/), operating in Bilbao, Madrid, and Munich, with strategic partners in Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, and Shanghai. Quanvia provides useful quantum solutions now, not in the possible future of others. It empowers the merging of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 


# Dr Farina Riaz
She is an accomplished research scholar, completing her collaborative PhD in Quantum Artificial Intelligence with CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific Industrial and Research Organisation) and the University of Southern Queensland. She has completed an internship at the CERN Lab in Switzerland, focusing on Grid Automation during her Master's in Computer Software Engineering. She has made significant contributions in her field by having 11 journal publications under her belt. She is an experienced lecturer having taught for 4 years at various universities in Dubai. She was also honoured as the runner-up for the People's Choice Award in Quantum Australia 2023 and is also an IBM Quantum Research Program Member. 

She is currently a Research fellow working closely with CSIRO Australia, working on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Security using Quantum technology. In her research, she has created ground-breaking models that have surpassed the effectiveness of Classical Machine Learning Methods.
