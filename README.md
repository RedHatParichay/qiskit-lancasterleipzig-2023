# qiskit-lancasterleipzig-2023

We are excited to announce that Lancaster University Leipzig is one of the 2 institutions based in Germany hosting an extension event as part of this year's Qiskit Fall Fest – a global gathering of quantum computing enthusiasts and experts. Qiskit, powered by IBM, is a great quantum computing software delivered in the form of a Python library. It allows students and researchers to create and simulate quantum circuits and algorithms. At Lancaster University Leipzig, we are committed to exploring the multifaceted realm of Quantum Computing, aiming to provide students with a holistic perspective on this cutting-edge field. To achieve this, we have planned a series of seminars and workshops that strike a perfect balance between academic rigour and real-world industrial insights. Our event is an integral part of IBM's Fall Fest, and we are proud to be associated with this global initiative. For more information, here is the event’s official [website](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest) (where you can see LU Leipzig being featured as part of the extension events hosts).

Come and meet one of the co-founders of [Kipu Quantum](https://kipu-quantum.com/)! Dr Enrique Solano. Kipu Quantum is a German quantum computing startup based in Karlsruhe and Berlin. What makes Kipu unique is its focus on application and hardware-specific quantum algorithms that are packaged into software products. 

# Dr Enrique Solano 
He is a very experienced individual in leading international research groups and centres in academic institutions as well as disruptive and productive innovation teams in deep tech startups. He has also founded another startup based in Spain, [Quanvia](https://www.quanvia.com/), operating in Bilbao, Madrid, and Munich, with strategic partners in Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, and Shanghai. Quanvia provides useful quantum solutions now, not in the possible future of others. It empowers the merging of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 


# Dr Farina Riaz
“Farina, through the Impossible Without You Programme, has commenced her CERC Postdoctoral Fellowship with CSIRO. Additionally, she has accomplished the collaborative PhD with CSIRO Data61 and at the University of Southern Queensland(UniSQ), specializing in quantum Artificial Intelligence. Her educational background includes a master’s degree in computer software engineering from Pakistan, where she also completed an internship at CERN Lab in Switzerland, focusing on Grid Automation. In 2007, she gained experience as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at NERO Company. With 9 publications in journals and conferences, she has made significant contributions to her field. During her PhD journey, Farina serves as the HDR Student representative at the UniSQ research group, actively participating in important research-related decision-making processes. She possesses 4 years of teaching experience as a lecturer in various universities in Dubai, UAE. Farina’s present research revolves around the utilization of Quantum Machine Learning Security. By conducting research at CSIRO Data61, she has created ground-breaking models that have surpassed the effectiveness of Classical Machine Learning methods. Her impressive portfolio includes over 11 journal publications, and she was also honoured as the runner-up for the People’s Choice Award in Quantum Australia 2023.”  Available at https://research.csiro.au/cybersecurity-quantum-systems/people/staff/
