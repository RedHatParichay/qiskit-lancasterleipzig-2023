# qiskit-lancasterleipzig-2023

We are excited to announce that Lancaster University Leipzig is one of the 2 institutions based in Germany hosting an extension event as part of this year's Qiskit Fall Fest – a global gathering of quantum computing enthusiasts and experts. Qiskit, powered by IBM, is a great quantum computing software delivered in the form of a Python library. It allows students and researchers to create and simulate quantum circuits and algorithms. At Lancaster University Leipzig, we are committed to exploring the multifaceted realm of Quantum Computing, aiming to provide students with a holistic perspective on this cutting-edge field. To achieve this, we have planned a series of seminars and workshops that strike a perfect balance between academic rigour and real-world industrial insights. Our event is an integral part of IBM's Fall Fest, and we are proud to be associated with this global initiative. For more information, here is the event’s official [website](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest) (where you can see LU Leipzig being featured as part of the extension events hosts).

Come and meet one of the co-founders of [Kipu Quantum](https://kipu-quantum.com/)! Dr Enrique Solano. Kipu Quantum is a German quantum computing startup based in Karlsruhe and Berlin. What makes Kipu unique is its focus on application and hardware-specific quantum algorithms that are packaged into software products. 

# Dr Enrique Solano 
He is a very experienced individual in leading international research groups and centres in academic institutions as well as disruptive and productive innovation teams in deep tech startups. He has also founded another startup based in Spain, [Quanvia](https://www.quanvia.com/), Quanvia provides useful quantum solutions now, not in the possible future of others. It empowers the merging of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 


# Dr Farina Riaz
She is currently a research scholar at the University of Southern Queensland working closely with CSIRO Australia, working on Artificial Intelligence using Quantum technology. She is also an IBM Quantum Researcher Program Member.
