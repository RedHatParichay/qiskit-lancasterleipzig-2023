# qiskit-lancasterleipzig-2023

We are excited to announce that Lancaster University Leipzig is one of the 2 institutions based in Germany hosting an extension event as part of this year's Qiskit Fall Fest – a global gathering of quantum computing enthusiasts and experts. Qiskit, powered by IBM, is a great quantum computing software delivered in the form of a Python library. It allows students and researchers to create and simulate quantum circuits and algorithms. At Lancaster University Leipzig, we are committed to exploring the multifaceted realm of Quantum Computing, aiming to provide students with a holistic perspective on this cutting-edge field. To achieve this, we have planned a series of seminars and workshops that strike a perfect balance between academic rigour and real-world industrial insights. Our event is an integral part of IBM's Fall Fest, and we are proud to be associated with this global initiative. For more information, here is the event’s official [website](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest) (where you can see LU Leipzig being featured as part of the extension events hosts).
