An example may help: Consider the conditional reset operation, which may sound familiar if you've ever used the [`reset`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reset.html) operation in Qiskit. While the reset operation is a non-unitary operation that resets the qubit to the zero state no matter the initial state, the conditional reset operation is performed on an already measured qubit to reset it to zero by applying a bit-flip X gate only if the qubit is in the one state, as determined from its measured value. The conditional reset can be a faster and less error-prone way to reset a qubit if it has already been measured."
